Overview
========
This module aims to setup and manage a L2TP VPN on Debian/lenny and 
Debian/squeeze. The goal of this module is to manage a VPN server that allows 
Apple mobile clients to connect and surf the local network and/or internet via 
this setup, and tied in with my existing authentication infrastructure 
(OpenLDAP).

This module leverages several Debian packages in order to accomplish it's goals:
	- L2TP server: xl2tpd
	- IPSec Server: openswan
	- Authentication: OpenLDAP & FreeRADIUS
	
This VPN has been tested on iPhone/iPad/OSX/Windows. Any L2TP capable client 
	
Out of scope
------------
* At the time of creation, iOS devices do not allow straight-up IPSec 
Road-Warrior type connections. As such, extra options such as Client 
Certificate Authentication are out of scope

* RADIUS AAA. RADIUS was leveraged as a tie-in between pppd and OpenLDAP to 
allow authentication. OpenLDAP schema extensions were not required, so AAA 
accounting is not enabled. 

* Firewall rules are managed outside of this module. However, it should be 
assumed that the following ports are open to the box(es) in question.
	- UDP 500
	- UDP 4500
	- UDP 1701
Masquerade rules should also be enabled to allow the PPP IP range to connect to
to the Internet

* LDAP. It is assumed that an appropriate LDAP server is setup, bind 
credentials exist, and everything has been tested. 


Variables
=========

Required 
--------
$ipsec_endpoint - this variable sets the 'right' endpoint for the IPSec VPN 
Tunnel. This should be the external IP of the server. 
	ex: $ipsec_endpoint = "1.2.3.4"
	
$ipsec_secret - this variable sets the IPSec Shared Secret used between 
road-warriors and the server. 
	ex: $ipsec_secret = "IreallyenjoyL2TPServers!"
	
$vpn_server - This is the server IP address used for the PPP tunnel between 
server and road-warriors. 
	ex: $vpn_server = "10.5.2.1"
	
$vpn_clients - This variable sets the assigned IP addresses between the Server 
and Road-Warrior clients. This number assumes a PtP connection between 
client/server, so as long as routing rules and firewall rules are managed 
appropriately, this range could be as small or as large as desired. 
	ex: $vpn_clients = "10.5.2.2 - 10.5.2.254" 
			
$vpn_dns - This variable sets the DNS server IP for VPN Road-Warrior clients to
utilize.

$ldap_server - Server address for the LDAP Server. 
	ex: $ldap_server = "ldap.test.com"

$ldap_bind_user - User to search for authentication in OpenLDAP 
	ex: $ldap_bind_user = "cn=radiususer,dc=test,dc=com"
	
$ldap_bind_pass - password for $ldap_bind_user. 
	ex: $ldap_bind_pass = "#IWishF0rMoreWishes#"
	
$ldap_basedn - Base DN for LDAP Searches (subordinate search). 
	ex: $ldap_basedn = "dc=test,dc=com"
	
$radius_secret - RADIUS secret from Radius Client (VPN Server) to Radius 
Server (localhost)

TODO
====
* Add nagios monitoring hook
* Add TLS Support to LDAP Connection
* Determine more secure way to store secrets when initializing this variable. 
	- $ldap_bind_pass : /etc/ldap.secure?
	- $ipsec_secret : auto-generation? 
* Modify configs to allow RADIUS server to exist on separate server (not 
localhost)
	- maybe fork RADIUS config into own puppet module
* Add CentOS/RHEL specific configurations
